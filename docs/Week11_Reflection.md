## ‚úçÔ∏è Section 1: Week 11 Reflection

### Key Takeaways
- The capstone project is a chance to bring together everything we‚Äôve learned.
- We are expected to create at least 3 features and 1 enhancement.
- Clean, modular code and a good user experience are essential.
- Weekly planning is important for pacing and managing scope.
- Creativity and polish will make my app stand out on Demo Day.

### Concept Connections
- Strong in: Tkinter GUI design, API usage, matplotlib graphing.
- Need more practice with: testing, packaging apps, error handling.
- Confident with `ttk`, `PIL`, and using `.env` for API keys.
- Learning how to organize large apps across multiple files and features.

### Early Challenges
- Managing multiple Tkinter frames and slide transitions.
- Getting the animated ‚Äúmoon friend‚Äù to appear only on the Almanac.
- Finding good moon phase data (solved with emoji chart workaround).
- Avoiding errors when the weather API returns incomplete data.

### Support Strategies
- Office hours for bug fixes and architecture help.
- Slack for live debugging and design feedback.
- Code reviews from peers and instructors if time allows.

## üß† Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale

| #  | Feature Name           | Difficulty (1‚Äì3) | Why You Chose It / Learning Goal                         |
|----|------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Current Weather Slide  | 2                | Display real-time weather from OpenWeatherMap API        |
| 2  | Forecast Slide         | 2                | Practice looping through forecast data & UI integration  |
| 3  | Graph Slide (Line)     | 3                | Use matplotlib with Tkinter to visualize temperature     |
| ‚Äì  | Almanac Enhancement    | ‚Äì                | Add moon phase emojis, sparkles, and retro visual charm  |

## üóÇÔ∏è Section 3: High-Level Architecture Sketch

### App Structure
- `main.py`: runs the app, handles navigation and layout
- `/features/`
  - `current_conditions.py`
  - `forecast.py`
  - `graph_view.py`
  - `almanac.py`
- `config.py`: loads environment variables
- `/data/`: text or JSON files (e.g. saved weather logs)
- `/assets/`: pixel art, gifs, fonts

### Data Flow
1. User enters a location ‚Üí `main.py` ‚Üí `get_weather(city)`
2. API returns data ‚Üí passed to each frame
3. Slides update their widgets based on that data
